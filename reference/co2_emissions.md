# CO2 emissions

This dataset represents CO2 emissions for a subset of country over the
period 1990 - 2022.

## Usage

``` r
co2_emissions
```

## Format

A data frame with 495 observations and 11 variables:

- `country` : Country - Geographic location.

- `year` : Year - Year of observation.

- `co2` : Annual CO2 emissions - Annual total emissions of carbon
  dioxide (CO2), excluding land-use change, measured in million tonnes.

- `co2_per_gdp` : Annual CO2 emissions per GDP (kg per
  international-\$) - Annual total emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2),
  excluding land-use change, measured in kilograms per dollar of GDP
  (2011 international-\$).

- `co2_per_capita` : Annual CO2 emissions (per capita) - Annual total
  emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), excluding land-use change, measured
  in tonnes per person.

- `co2_growth_abs` : Annual CO2 emissions growth (abs) - Annual growth
  in total emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), excluding land-use change,
  measured in million tonnes.

- `co2_growth_prct` : Annual CO2 emissions growth (%) - Annual
  percentage growth in total emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2),
  excluding land-use change.

- `co2_per_unit_energy` : Annual CO2 emissions per unit energy (kg per
  kilowatt-hour) - Annual total emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2),
  excluding land-use change, measured in kilograms per kilowatt-hour of
  primary energy consumption.

- `consumption_co2` : Annual consumption-based CO2 emissions - Annual
  consumption-based emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), measured in
  million tonnes.

- `consumption_co2_per_capita` : Per capita consumption-based CO2
  emissions - Annual consumption-based emissions of carbon dioxide
  (CO2), measured in tonnes per person.

- `consumption_co2_per_gdp` : Annual consumption-based CO2 emissions per
  GDP (kg per international-\$) - Annual consumption-based emissions of
  carbon dioxide (CO2), measured in kilograms per dollar of GDP (2011
  international-\$).
