# Create a Sankey Chart

Create a Sankey Chart

## Usage

``` r
v_sankey(
  vc,
  mapping = NULL,
  data = NULL,
  name = NULL,
  ...,
  serie_id = NULL,
  data_id = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- vc:

  A chart initialized with
  [`vchart()`](https://dreamrs.github.io/vchartr/reference/vchart.md).

- mapping:

  Default list of aesthetic mappings to use for chart.

- data:

  Default dataset to use for chart. If not already a `data.frame`, it
  will be coerced to with `as.data.frame`.

- name:

  Name for the serie, only used for single serie (no `color`/`fill`
  aesthetic supplied).

- ...:

  Additional parameters for the serie.

- data_id, serie_id:

  ID for the data/serie, can be used to further customize the chart with
  [`v_specs()`](https://dreamrs.github.io/vchartr/reference/v_specs.md).

## Value

A [`vchart()`](https://dreamrs.github.io/vchartr/reference/vchart.md)
`htmlwidget` object.

## Examples

``` r
library(vchartr)

# Basic Sankey Chart

  v_sankey(aes(target, source, value = value))
